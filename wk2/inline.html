<article><header>  <p>posted by Jude Says, November 15, 2020</p></header><h2>Low and Slow</h2><p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p><p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p><p>Jwie1997@gmail.com407 - 963 - 5056</p><p>Warning: <i>Sous vide</i> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p></article>
