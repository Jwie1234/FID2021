<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<a href="index.html" class="medialinks">Home</a>
	<p>Founded in 2021, Camp Freedom is a non-profit organization aimed to help local youth who are believe in god and yet are also LGBT. We love connecting the LGBT with our family of Christians.
	<p>Our mission is to give teens a week of judgement free zone where they can express themselves while worshiping Christ.
